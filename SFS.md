Software Functional Specification
Agentic System Infrastructure
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose

This Software Functional Specification (SFS) document outlines the design and functionality of an Agentic System Infrastructure that enables users to deploy and interact with AI agents without writing code. The system will initially focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agents that process documents and respond to user queries based on the extracted information.
1.2 Scope

The initial version of the system will:

    Allow users to deploy RAG agents by specifying document sources (PDFs or other supported formats)
    Automatically process, index, and embed documents for retrieval
    Suggest optimal chunking methods based on document analysis with the ability for users to override defaults
    Deploy each agent in a containerized environment using Docker and manage lifecycle through Kubernetes
    Provide a chat interface for real-time interactions via API endpoints
    Track agent deployments, usage, and performance

2. System Architecture
2.1 High-Level Architecture

![System Architecture Diagram]

The system follows a microservices architecture with the following core components:

    API Gateway Service:
        Handles external requests, authentication, and request routing.
        Optionally backed by Nginx or Traefik for load balancing.

    Agent Manager Service:
        Orchestrates the agent lifecycle (creation, deployment, monitoring).
        Leverages the Agno framework for agent management and messaging.

    Document Processor Service:
        Ingests, analyzes, and processes documents.
        Determines optimal chunking strategies and generates embeddings using FastAPI and Python libraries.

    Database Service:
        Utilizes PostgreSQL to store metadata for users, agents, and documents.
        Integrates PgVector for embedding storage and semantic similarity search.

    Vector Database Service:
        Implements PgVector to maintain document embeddings for efficient retrieval.

    Agent Containers:
        Each agent is deployed within its own Docker container.
        Managed by Kubernetes for scaling, health checks, and resource allocation.

2.2 Agent Deployment Workflow

    User Request:
        The user submits a request to create a new agent with document sources.

    Request Validation:
        API Gateway validates the request, authenticates the user, and forwards it to the Agent Manager.

    Record Creation:
        Agent Manager creates a corresponding record in PostgreSQL.

    Document Processing:
        Document Processor ingests and processes the provided documents.
        Automatically detects document type, applies the optimal chunking strategy, generates embeddings, and stores them in PgVector.

    Container Deployment:
        Agent Manager creates a Docker container with the processed data and configuration.
        Kubernetes deploys and manages the container.

    Completion Notification:
        The system returns a unique agent identifier and a memorable agent name to the user.

2.3 User-Agent Communication Structure

    Message Flow:
        User sends a chat message to an agent via the API.
        API Gateway authenticates and routes the message to the appropriate agent container.

    Processing:
        The agent retrieves relevant document chunks using semantic search on PgVector.
        Constructs a prompt and invokes the LLM for generating a response.

    Response Delivery:
        The response, along with citation information, is sent back to the user via the API Gateway.
        All interactions are logged for monitoring and further improvements.

2.4 RAG Agent Information Processing

    Document intake through user-specified sources (local files or URLs)
    Automatic document type detection and structure analysis
    Intelligent chunking with customizable strategies
    Embedding generation for each chunk using Python-based libraries
    Storage of embeddings in the vector database (PgVector integrated with Postgres)
    Semantic search on embeddings for retrieving relevant context
    Dynamic prompt construction and response generation via the LLM

5. System Workflows
5.1 Agent Creation Workflow

            Optional agent name (system assigns a unique, memorable name if not provided)
            Document sources (files or URLs)
            Optional configuration parameters

    Validation and Record Creation:
        API Gateway validates the request and authenticates the user.
        Agent Manager creates an entry in the PostgreSQL database.

    Document Processing:
        Document Processor extracts text, detects document type, and selects the appropriate chunking strategy.
        Embeddings are generated and stored in PgVector.

    Container Deployment:
        Agent Manager generates a Docker container configuration using Agno.
        Kubernetes deploys the container, setting resource limits and health checks.

    Activation and Notification:
        The system verifies that the agent is operational.
        A unique agent identifier and accessible agent name are returned to the user.

5.2 Document Ingestion Workflow

    Source Reception:
        The system receives document sources (local files or URLs).

    Text Extraction and Analysis:
        Raw text is extracted.
        Document type and structure are detected.

    Chunking and Embedding:
        Appropriate chunking method is selected (e.g., section-based, paragraph-based, fixed-size with overlap).
        Embeddings for each chunk are generated and stored in PgVector.

    Metadata Storage:
        Chunk metadata and processing status are recorded in PostgreSQL.

5.3 Chat Interaction Workflow

    Message Submission:
        User sends a message to a specific agent via the API.

    Authentication and Routing:
        API Gateway authenticates the user and verifies access.
        Message is routed to the appropriate agent container.

    Processing:
        The agent uses semantic search on PgVector to retrieve relevant chunks.
        The context is assembled, and the LLM generates a response with citation information.

    Response Delivery:
        The response is sent back to the user.
        The conversation is logged in the database.

5.4 Agent Management Workflow

    Listing and Retrieval:
        User requests a list of deployed agents.
        The system returns agent details from PostgreSQL.

    Operational Commands:
        Users can start, stop, update, or delete agents.
        The Agent Manager handles these operations and reflects changes in Kubernetes and the database.
