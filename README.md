# Project "Warder" – README 👋

Hello, dear traveler! Welcome to “Warder,” a project name inspired by the Wheel of Time universe (though it doesn’t mean we’re building a security application! We’re more like the dedicated companions—the "Warders"—than bouncers. No swords required... for now 😉).

Below you’ll find a whimsical overview of what’s cooking in our cauldron of code, guided by the revelations in our Software Functional Specification (SFS). Grab your cloak, your imagination, and maybe a cup of something warm as we embark on this grand quest!

---

## 1. Introduction 🏰

1) “Warder” is all about an Agentic System, enabling you to deploy and converse with AI agents without writing code.
2) We rely on the majestic powers of Python and FastAPI to orchestrate these magical containers.
3) Imagine an army of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) agents who roam your documents (with user permission!) seeking knowledge. Like warders of the White Tower, they stand ready to assist, but with data-based wisdom instead of swords.

---

## 2. Why "Warder"? ⚔️

1) In the Wheel of Time, a Warder bonds with an Aes Sedai, ready to protect and serve. 
2) Here, “Warder” is our system that bonds with your AI agents, ensuring they stay functional and vigilant in a containerized environment. 
3) No, you don’t need chain mail. You do need Docker and Kubernetes, though.

---

## 3. Quick Peek at Our Stack 🛠️

1) **Language & Framework**: Python + FastAPI → Because we like it quick and easy. 
2) **Agentic Framework**: Agno → Our secret sauce for agent lifecycle and messaging. 
3) **Database**: PostgreSQL → It’s the stuff that keeps data stored. 
4) **VectorDB**: PgVector → For fancy semantic search and vector embeddings. 
5) **No Frontend Yet**: Don’t worry, the White Tower wasn’t built in a day (or was that Tar Valon?). 
6) **Containers**: Docker + Kubernetes → Summon containers at will. Each agent gets its own mini fortress.

---

## 4. Agents? All the Agents! 🤖

1) You can create new agents by sending an API request. 
2) Each agent gets its own Docker container and runs happily under the watchful eye of Kubernetes. 
3) Agents share a common database (like an inn where they store their scrolls and gossip).
4) They’re not mystical illusions—they actually exist on your cluster, ready to answer queries (like warders responding to a threat!). 
5) Our agents are RAG-based, meaning they fetch relevant data from your knowledge trove before crafting answers.

---

## 5. Communication With Agents 📡

1) Each container exposes endpoints through a port (like calling out to a secluded tower). 
2) Send your queries or chat prompts to that magical port, and the container’s occupant—your agent—will respond with knowledge gleaned from rummaging through your documents. 
3) We harness the might of semantic search, thanks to PgVector, to grant you the best chunk of relevant text for your query.

---

## 6. Swagger to the Rescue 🌐

1) Let’s face it: even warders need a map. 
2) With Swagger API docs at your disposal, you can navigate the labyrinth of endpoints with ease. 
3) Just head to the provided URL once your system is running, and you’ll see all possible requests you can harness. 
4) No hush-hush NDA to get these docs—it’s all out in the open.

---

## 7. Reference to the Software Functional Specification (SFS) 📜

1) Our SFS is basically the rulebook establishing how everything should work:
   - Agent creation
   - Document processing
   - Chat interactions
   - Agent management
2) These are spelled out with a level of detail that might make an overachieving White Tower novice proud. 
3) It’s a thorough blueprint for how we spin up agents, chunk and embed documents, and maintain containerized microservices.

---

## 8. Summon the Containers ⚙️

1) Each new agent calls upon the Docker Mage, who conjures a container to house that agent. 
2) Kubernetes then wrangles those containers into neat, organized structures. Think of it as your personal tower full of wards and illusions, minus the Trollocs. 
3) Resource usage, lifecycle management, and scaling? All handled by the unstoppable duo of Docker + K8s.

---

## 9. Database Outside the Fortress 🗄️

1) Our database is the eternal library that sits outside any single agent’s domain. 
2) Agents come and go, but the data remains persistent in Postgres. 
3) With the help of PgVector, documents get embedded for semantic search. 
   - That means if you ask an agent “What was that prophecy about the Dragon Reborn?” it can rummage through your entire library (assuming you stored it there!) and fetch relevant context. 
4) No need to worry about your data vanishing when an agent container is replaced or re-deployed. The knowledge endures.

---

## 10. The Journey of a Query ⚔️🐉

Picture yourself as an aspiring Aes Sedai or simply a curious tinkerer:

1) You utter (type) your query to an agent (like calling out “Who are the Forsaken?”). 
2) The agent checks the relevant chunks from your documents. 
3) It then forges a response with that info. 
4) You get a neatly packaged answer, possibly with citations. 
5) Everyone goes on to fight the Dark One… or maybe just moves on to the next question.

---

## 11. Missing Features? 🏗️

1) We do not have a gleaming front-end yet. That’s still on the horizon like the distant mountains of Mist. 
2) We’re focusing on the backend architecture first. 
3) The unstoppable wave of new features will come soon, possibly by the next turn of the Wheel. 
4) Stay tuned for upcoming expansions, such as:
   - More agent types (analysis agents, code generation agents, maybe even Loial the Ogier librarian agent).
   - Enhanced chunking operations that can cut large tomes like “The Shadow Rising” down to tidy squares (or triangles).
   - Potential real-time streaming responses to make the experience more epic.

## 12. How to Cast the Summon Spell (a.k.a. Running the System) 🔮

Here’s the short version:

1) Clone the repo. 
2) Make sure Docker and Kubernetes are installed (like recruiting both a Warder and an Aes Sedai—and ensuring they get along).
3) Fire up the Python application with FastAPI. 
4) Check out the Swagger docs at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) once it’s running. 
5) Create an agent by sending a POST request with your documents attached or their URLs. 
6) Wait for your container to spin up. 
7) Profit… or answer queries. Possibly both.

---

## 13. Acknowledgments & Kudos 💐

1) Our fellow open-source heroes for making Docker and Kubernetes awesome. 
2) The Wheel of Time for inspiring the epic name. May the Light keep shining on our logs. 
3) The Agentic folks for building a framework that truly handles agent lifecycles better than a Warder guiding the newly raised Aes Sedai. 
4) Postgres and PgVector for making sure we can store data and find it swiftly, like an Ogier that never forgets.

---

## 14. Who This Project Is For 🏹

1) Anyone wanting to deploy specialized AI agents to handle documents without writing code. 
2) Tech enthusiasts who enjoy container orchestration. 
4) The sort who might read a 14-book epic fantasy series and think, “What if I could spawn an agent to summarize each volume?”

---

## 15. Goodbye for Now 🌟

Feel free to contribute, open issues, or just sit back and watch the Wheel weave as it wills. The Age of Agents is upon us. “Warder” stands ready to protect your data interests, spin up containers, and keep the conversation going. If you find yourself a bit lost, remember: there’s always a bigger fish… or maybe that was a different reference. 

Until next time, may your Docker images build swiftly, your containers remain healthy, and your queries find their context. 

**Thank you for reading!**

## 16. Additional Lines of Wisdom (Do Not Read the Dark Prophecies...) 

1) The best way to handle ephemeral containers is to rely on permanent data storage.
2) A flexible chunking strategy is your shield. 
3) The code is but a thread in the Pattern, weaving you to your destiny. 
4) The Chosen might choose to break your code, so implement proper error handling. 
5) Creating an agent is like forging a bond. Make sure you’re prepared (and always have enough compute resources!). 
6) There is no beginning or end to the Docker logs, but they can really fill up your disk space. 
7) Keep your database migrations in check lest the Pattern unravel. 
8) “Warder” is not the city watch; it’s more like your personal fellowship of containerized AI. 
9) Skal or rejoice, if that’s your style. 
10) Summon your agent, oh dear user, for the Light stands with the creators of your cluster. 
11) Use the Swagger docs to find your path amid the chaos. 
12) Always test in a staging environment before going to production, if you value your sanity! 
13) The next feature might be channeling-based, or not… 
14) Docker images come and go, but data is eternal—stay mindful. 
15) Move along, there’s nothing sinister in the NFRs… 
16) Peace, love, and containers. 🎉
