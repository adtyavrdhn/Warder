# AI Agent Service Architecture Plan

## 1. Infrastructure & Hosting

### Recommended Architecture
- **Containerized Deployment**: Use Docker containers for the backend service to ensure consistency across environments.
- **Kubernetes Orchestration**: For managing multiple agent instances and scaling resources dynamically.
- **Stateless Application Design**: Keep the core application stateless to facilitate horizontal scaling.
- **Separate Data Stores**:
  - PostgreSQL for structured data (user info, agent configs).
  - Vector database for embeddings (already using PgVector).
  - Object storage for documents and agent artifacts.

### Resource Optimization
- **Agent Pooling**: Implement an agent pool to reuse agent instances when possible.
- **Resource Limits**: Set CPU/memory limits per agent to prevent resource exhaustion.
- **Lazy Loading**: Only load agent resources when needed, unload inactive agents.

## 2. Multi-Tenancy & Isolation

### User Isolation
- **Database-Level Isolation**: Extend your existing schema approach with user-specific schemas or row-level security.
- **Resource Quotas**: Implement per-user limits on:
  - Number of active agents.
  - Storage capacity for knowledge bases.
  - API call frequency.
  - Document processing limits.

### Security Measures
- **Tenant Identification**: Add a `user_id` field to all models (agents, documents).
- **Authorization Middleware**: Implement a middleware that validates all requests against user ownership.
- **Resource Namespacing**: Namespace all resources (file paths, database entries) with user identifiers.

## 3. Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Stateless API Layer**: Scale the API gateway independently.
- **Agent Worker Pools**: Dedicated worker pools for agent execution.
- **Document Processing Queue**: Separate queue for document processing tasks.

### Handling Spikes
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-user rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- **Request Queuing**: Queue non-urgent requests during high load.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Define fallback behaviors for overload scenarios.

### Database Scaling
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimize database connections.
- **Read Replicas**: For query-heavy operations.
- **Database Sharding**: Consider sharding by `user_id` for very large deployments.

## 4. Agent Persistence

### State Management
- **Agent State Storage**:
  - Store agent configurations in PostgreSQL (extending your current approach).
  - Store conversation history in a time-series optimized store.
  - Cache active agent state in Redis.

### Knowledge Base Management
- **Document Processing Pipeline**:
  - Parallel processing for large documents.
  - Incremental updates to knowledge bases.
  - Versioning of knowledge bases.

### Backup & Recovery
- **Regular Backups**: Schedule backups of agent configurations and knowledge bases.
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Allow restoring agents to previous states.

## 5. User Management & Authentication

### Authentication System
- **JWT-Based Authentication**: Implement JWT tokens with refresh capability.
- **OAuth Integration**: Support third-party authentication providers.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Define roles (admin, user, readonly) with appropriate permissions.

### User Management
- **User Registration Flow**: Email verification, account setup.
- **User Profile Management**: Allow users to manage their profile and preferences.
- **Team Collaboration**: Optional feature to share agents within teams.

## 6. Real-time Interaction

### Communication Channels
- **WebSocket API**: Implement WebSockets for real-time agent interactions.
- **Server-Sent Events**: Alternative for one-way real-time updates.
- **Long-Polling Fallback**: For environments where WebSockets aren't supported.

### Event-Driven Architecture
- **Event Bus**: Implement a central event bus (using Redis Pub/Sub or Kafka).
- **Event Types**:
  - Agent state changes.
  - Document processing updates.
  - Knowledge base modifications.
  - User interactions.

### Streaming Responses
- **Chunked Responses**: Stream agent responses as they're generated.
- **Progress Updates**: Provide progress updates for long-running operations.

## 7. Extensibility

### Plugin System
- **Agent Extensions**: Allow plugins to extend agent capabilities.
- **Custom Tool Integration**: Framework for integrating external APIs and tools.
- **Custom Agent Types**: Support for different agent architectures beyond RAG.

### API Integration
- **Webhook Support**: Allow agents to trigger external systems via webhooks.
- **API Key Management**: Secure storage and usage of third-party API keys.
- **Integration Templates**: Pre-built integrations for common services.

## Technical Implementation Plan
